    - Let's code up the architecture. We will stack 3 {convolution + relu + maxpooling} modules.

    - Our first convolution extracts 16 filters, the following one extracts 32 filters, and the last one extracts 64 filters."""

#%% Data Preprocessing.
""" Let's set up data generators that will read pictures in our source folders, convert them to float32 tensors, 
    and feed them (with their labels) to our network. We'll have one generator for the training images and one for the validation images. 
    Our generators will yield batches of 20 images of size 150x150 and their labels (binary).

    As you may already know, data that goes into neural networks should usually be normalized in some way to make it more amenable 
    to processing by the network. (It is uncommon to feed raw pixels into a convnet.) In our case, we will preprocess our images by 
    normalizing the pixel values to be in the [0, 1] range (originally all values are in the [0, 255] range).

    In Keras this can be done via the keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator class using the rescale parameter. This ImageDataGenerator
    class allows you to instantiate generators of augmented image batches (and their labels) via .flow(data, labels) or 
    .flow_from_directory(directory). These generators can then be used with the Keras model methods that accept data generators as 
    inputs: fit_generator, evaluate_generator, and predict_generator."""
